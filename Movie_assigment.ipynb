            "Review 2: ? big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pin these are the words to best describe this terrible movie i love cheesy horror movies and i've seen hundreds but this had got to be on of the worst ever made the plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughable the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is it's just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal ? the hair is big lots of boobs ? men wear those cut ? shirts that show off their ? sickening that men actually wore them and the music is just ? trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and ? taking away bodies and the gym still doesn't close for ? all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80's and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then\n",
            "Review 3: ? this has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s when my friends i were watching this film being the target audience it was aimed at we just sat watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was the rest of the time everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had ? working to watch this feeble excuse for a film it must have looked like a great idea on paper but on film it looks like no one in the film has a clue what is going on crap acting crap costumes i can't get across how ? this is to watch save yourself an hour a bit of your life\n",
